# kubujuss WIP
This is my second custom keyboard. I started with a Keychron K2 with lubed Gateron Yellows and a custom slimmer case without the battery. It has served me well but the barrage of keyboard content has slowly built up the urge to make another one.

Typically there seems to be some keyboard inbetween a 75% layout and minimal split keyboard, but the soothing and dangerously approachable videos of Ben Wallok have radicalised me beyond repair.

## So here we are
34 keys split into 2 seperate halves.

Column stagger was adjusted by eye to match some illustrations and mockups I made on paper.

I found the pinkie cluster idea on accient, when I tried to find images of split keyboards on google. I found an image of [Wubbo](https://github.com/cacheworks/Wubbo). It seemed weird at first but the first tests on paper seemed promising. Time will tell if it works in real life as well.

## Thanks
Big thanks for [FlatFootFox](https://flatfootfox.com/) for his awesome [introduction to ergogen v4](https://flatfootfox.com/ergogen-introduction/). This guide taught me everything I know about ergogen and kicad.

And a gigantic thanks for @christianselig, for helping me figure out how to make both PCB halves in one ergogen file.
